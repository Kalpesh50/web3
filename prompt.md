i am creating a frontend for my web3 project using nextjs 
now i want to create a landing page using shadcn and aceternity ui for main landing page 
the website will be mainly for android audience so the design should be minimalistic and clean with respect to android screen size.
make it also responsive.
the main landing page must have a connect wallet button too try to use aceternity ui components for that and for background of landing page.
